DiceDB is a drop-in replacement of Redis with SQL-based real-time reactivity baked in.

> Note: DiceDB is still in development and it supports a subset of Redis commands. So, please do not use it in production. But, feel free to go through the [open issues](https://github.com/DiceDB/dice/issues) and contribute to help us speed up the development.

## How is it different from Redis?

1. DiceDB is multi-threaded and follows [shared-nothing architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared-nothing_architecture).
2. DiceDB supports a new command called `QWATCH` that lets clients listen to a SQL query and get notified in real-time whenever data changes.

## Get started

### Using Docker

The easiest way to start using DiceDB is through [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) by running the following command.

```
$ docker run dicedb/dice-server
```

The above command will start the DiceDB server running locally on the port `7379` and you can connect
to it using DiceDB CLI and SDKs.

> Note: Given it is a drop-in replacement of Redis, you can also use any Redis CLI and SDK to connect to DiceDB.

### Setting up for local development

To run DiceDB for local development or running from source, you will need

1. [Golang](https://go.dev/)
2. Any of the below supported platform environment:
    1. [Linux based environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Linux_distributions)
    2. [OSX (Darwin) based environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/dicedb/dice
$ cd dice
$ go run main.go
```

## Setting up CLI

The best way to connect to DiceDB is using DiceDB CLI and you can install it by running the following command.

```
$ pip install dicedb-cli
```

> Because DiceDB speaks Redis dialect, you can connect to it with any Redis Client and SDK also.
> But if you are planning to use the `QWATCH` feature then you need to use the DiceDB CLI.

The easiest way to get started with DiceDB is using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) by running the following command.

```
$ docker run dicedb/dice-server
```

The above command will start the DiceDB server running locally on the port `7379` and you can connect
to it using DiceDB CLI and SDKs.

> Note: Given it is a drop-in replacement of Redis, you can also use any Redis CLI and SDK to connect to DiceDB.

## Setup CLI

The best way to connect to DiceDB is using DiceDB CLI and you can install it by running the following command.

```
$ pip install dicedb-cli
```

> Because DiceDB speaks Redis dialect, you can connect to it with any Redis Client and SDK also.
> But if you are planning to use the `QWATCH` feature then you need to use the DiceDB CLI.

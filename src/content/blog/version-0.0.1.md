In the latest release of DiceDB, version 0.0.1, we have implemented several critical features and optimizations that significantly enhance the performance, security, and cross-platform compatibility. As the lead developer, I will walk you through the key improvements we have made.

One of the most impactful changes is the implementation of a background thread for BGREWRITEAOF. This allows for asynchronous rewriting of the Append-Only File (AOF), which is crucial for maintaining data persistence without blocking the main thread. The inline documentation for this feature has been added to provide clarity on its functionality and usage.

We've made strides in optimizing memory usage through key interning, which reduces the memory footprint for key references. This is particularly beneficial in scenarios with a high number of repeated keys. Additionally, we've implemented a `varint` encoding for unsigned integers, which allows for more efficient storage of variable-length integer data.

To improve data structures and querying capabilities, we've added support for QINT (Quick Integer) and QueueRef. These implementations offer optimized storage and retrieval for integer data and queue references, respectively. We've also introduced STACKREF support, enhancing our ability to handle stack-based data efficiently.

For probabilistic data structures, we've incorporated Bloom filters. These space-efficient structures allow for rapid set membership tests, which can significantly speed up certain types of queries.

In terms of I/O handling, we've made all file descriptors non-blocking and implemented an interface abstraction for platform-specific I/O multiplexing. These changes contribute to improved concurrency and better resource utilization across different operating systems.

Security has been a focal point in this release. We've disabled Cross Protocol Scripting to mitigate potential vulnerabilities. This proactive measure enhances the overall security posture of DiceDB.

Cross-platform compatibility has been expanded with the addition of OSX support. We've also set up GitHub Actions to build Dice for various platforms, streamlining our continuous integration process and ensuring consistent builds across different environments.

To support larger workloads, we've enhanced our ability to handle large inputs and expanded our test suite. This improvement allows DiceDB to maintain its performance and reliability even under increased data volumes.

For visual distinction, we've replaced the dice emoji with the Unicode character "âš„". This subtle change provides a more consistent appearance across different systems and fonts.

Lastly, we've made several documentation improvements, including fixing typos and adding inline documentation for functions in eval.go. These enhancements contribute to better code readability and maintainability.

# DiceDB Docs

We have ported the `docs` into the main [dice](https://github.com/dicedb/dice) repository and
can be found inside the `docs` folder.

This repository will be cleaned up now and deleted after two weeks, once all the open PRs are merged. The related tasks are labelled with [`documentation`](https://github.com/DiceDB/dice/labels/documentation) and you can find them under the primary dice repo.

Thank you once again for contributing to DiceDB. It means a ton.
